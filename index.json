Also stripped out the cover image and internationalization support to make it simpler.   Comments section is now just a link to send me a message on Twitter. Comments were blocking me from moving to a static site, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t common, so I decided not to handle them right now. HighlightJS now pulled in from CDNJS - custom header and custom footer.  Didn\u0026rsquo;t really like the Papermod default HighlightJS colours, I pull in Monokai-Sublime. 32KB of Javascript doesn\u0026rsquo;t get served by me, important if I move off of Github Pages This is where the drop-in isn\u0026rsquo;t great: Papermod compiles highlightJS CSS during the CSS bundling.\nThe CSS is functionally useless because it promptly gets replaced by the CDNJS one, but I can\u0026rsquo;t replace it without making changes to the theme.   Image shortcode updated to resize images to 1280px \u0026amp; use srcset to provide responsive variants for smaller screens.  Liberally copied from Laura Kalbag\u0026rsquo;s own attempt at resizing images.   Enabled hardWraps on the markdown renderer so line breaks are used instead of the generated paragraph being smushed together.  Could do 2 trailing spaces before the EOL character, but that would get deleted by the linter.   Favicon is the Computer Disk emoji.
