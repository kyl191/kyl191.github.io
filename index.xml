      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a designer, so I just found a theme I liked, and ran with that. Chose PaperMod, though Fuji remains a future possibility.
Hugo is actually pretty decent at selective overrides, so the underlying theme isn&amp;rsquo;t modified. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to manage git merges, though this complicated some aspects.
Changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made  Post page footer reordered to have the comment section come before the share buttons.  Also stripped out the cover image and internationalization support to make it simpler.</description>
